# Wind-Speed-Prediction-System
This project forecasts wind speed to improve wind power generation, reduce costs, and mitigate wind-related natural hazards. It analyzes climate trends, issues early warnings, and evaluates Machine Learning techniques for accuracy in weather prediction, supporting sustainability and disaster preparedness.

Project Overview
Wind speed prediction plays a crucial role in:

Enhancing wind power generation planning and optimizing resource usage.
Mitigating risks associated with severe wind-related natural hazards, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, and large hail.
Identifying climate trends and issuing early warnings for extreme weather conditions.
This project evaluates the effectiveness of various Machine Learning algorithms in predicting wind speed using the provided weather dataset.
