# Wind-Speed-Prediction-System
This project forecasts wind speed to improve wind power generation, reduce costs, and mitigate wind-related natural hazards. It analyzes climate trends, issues early warnings, and evaluates Machine Learning techniques for accuracy in weather prediction, supporting sustainability and disaster preparedness.

## Project Overview

Wind speed prediction plays a crucial role in:
- **Enhancing Renewable Energy Planning:** Supports wind power generation and optimizes resource usage.
- **Mitigating Natural Hazards:** Predicts severe weather events (e.g., thunderstorms, tornadoes) to minimize disruptions.
- **Analyzing Climate Trends:** Identifies weather patterns to detect anomalies and issue early warnings.

This project evaluates the effectiveness of various Machine Learning algorithms in predicting wind speed using the provided weather dataset.
